# public-health-projects

This is a personal archive of lightweight, exploratory projects developed alongside my doctoral research on the sustainability and scalability of public health programs.

My research sits at the intersection of project management, systems thinking, and health equity â€” and this space allows me to reflect, experiment, and learn in the open.

## Focus Areas

- Public health project analysis
- Program scalability and governance
- Volunteer participation trends
- SDG-linked data insights
- Research structure and synthesis
- Light data wrangling and visualisation

## Notes

These are informal, reflective, and often in-progress. They're not polished products, but small steps in building slow, thoughtful knowledge around complex systems.
